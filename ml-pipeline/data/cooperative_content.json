IF ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS CAN REFER A TRUCK DRIVER TO US AND WE HIRE THEM, YOU WILL RECEIVE A $1,000 CREDIT ON YOUR ACCOUNT!\nJan 12th, 2025 USDA unfortunately released a very bearish report for corn today that sent prices sharply lower. March corn closed 24 cents lower on the day. They increased harvested acres 1.3 million, increased yield 0.5 bpa to 186.5 bpa, both much higher than pre report expectations. Dec 1st stocks on hand also came in about 300 million more than expectations. Ending stocks were set at 2.227 billion, the highest in several years. The soybean numbers were more friendly, yield was unchanged from last month, and they cut exports which was mostly expected. This left ending stocks at 350 million, 25 million over last year. They did raise the Brazilian crop estimate on beans 3 million metric tons (110 million bushels), which was justified with their good growing conditions so far. It most likely takes a South American weather issue to rally the market now which is less likely on beans as Brazil will start harvesting soon, but they will plant most of their corn after that so there is some weather risk for the corn crop yet. Also Argentina has turned drier which is worth watching. Other than this a positive US biofuel policy which is expected to be released a some point fairly soon could help soybean demand as well.\n*OUR BIDS ARE DELAYED 10 MINUTES ON OUR WEBSITE AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

    "content": "Our Coop\nSince 1930, when FSC began as a petroleum supply cooperative, this organization has been dedicated to providing essential resources for farmers and local consumers. Launching a company during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl years wasn\u2019t easy, but the cost efficiencies and service FSC offered allowed the fledgling company to survive. Back then, cooperative members banding together was still a novel concept.\nToday\u2019s farmers and consumers have good reason to consider the value of mutual investment every time they receive their dividend checks. Only a cooperative rewards its shareholders for also doing business with the company they own. And only a cooperative on a sound financial footing can reward patrons while consistently improving the services it offers.\nFSC is not the largest cooperative in terms of widespread locations, yet it measures up against others in terms of return on investment. How does that happen? We remain true to the original FSC mandate to put knowledgeable, dedicated people into the field. The services they provide and the connections our employees form enable us to know what information, facilities, and equipment our customers expect from us today and, more importantly, what they\u2019ll need us to provide in the years ahead.",
